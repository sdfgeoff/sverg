 - [X] Transform stroke points based on canvas context
 - [X] Load brush images
 - [X] Sort out brush transparency blending
 - [X] Check operation insertion order (why do strokes render underneath)
 - [x] Export depsgraph as dotfile for analysis
 - [x] Rename "child" in depsgraph to "depends_on" 
 - [x] Sort out render order for layers
 - [ ] Dynamically allocate textures on GPU based on depgraph allocation
 - [ ] Sort out render caching.
 
At this point evaluate feasibility. Do some daily spitpaints. Figure out how
many brush strokes a piece of digital art has etc. etc. 

 - [ ] Unify brush glyphs into depgraph to avoid invalidation issues
 - [ ] Separate brushes from glyps (brushes are painter-concepts, glyphs are sverg concepts)
 
 - [ ] Decide on architecture for python side
    - [X] Create color picker for brush
    - [x] Create size slider for brush
    - [ ] Create brush editor
    - [ ] Create layer select widget
 - [ ] Add brush rotation as an option 
 
 - [ ] Redo file format as non-binary-dump
 - [ ] Rename to sverg
 
 
 - [ ] Implement layer blend operation
 - [ ] Implement simple fill operation
 - [ ] Implement gradient fill operation.
